Task Title: WGCNA Analysis of RNA-Seq Data from GSE148355

Objective:
Perform a Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) on a publicly available RNA-Seq dataset (GSE148355) to identify modules of co-expressed genes and determine their association with clinical traits such as population type, gender, and age. Subsequently, identify hub genes within the most relevant module.

Client Requirements (Hypothetical):
- Use raw count data (from GEO) for input.
- Perform filtering for highly variable genes.
- Determine optimal soft-thresholding power.
- Construct a gene network, detect modules, and correlate with traits.
- Identify and annotate hub genes in the green module.
- Visualize results in dendrograms, heatmaps, and MM vs GS plots.
- Export annotated gene expression data and hub genes.

Notes:
- Dataset GSE148355 is sourced from the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148355) and is publicly available.
- No personally identifiable information (PII) or confidential data is included in the analysis.
